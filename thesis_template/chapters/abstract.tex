An increasing use of heterogeneous mobile platforms forces the design of more efficient schedulers. Such platforms are comprised of processing units that differ in time and energy performance. A scheduler then aims at finding a suitable trade-off between runtime and energy consumption. We propose new optimal and suboptimal scheduling techniques based on the notion of state-transition graphs, which model possible programs execution schedules over different processing unit types. As a scheduling objective we chose Energy-Delay Product metric that aggregates time and energy consumption. Our schedulers are implemented by a C++ Scheduler tool, which is available on demand.
